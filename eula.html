        <h2>Indemnification</h2>

          You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its parents,
          subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and

          the Application; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or
          regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.
        </p>
        <h2>No Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          The Application is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS
          AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of
          any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
          Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and
          their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
          all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
          respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
          non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of
          dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
          limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
          undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the
          Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results,
          be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems
          or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
          reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
          can or will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
          company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
          express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
          Application, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Application will be uninterrupted or
          error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
          information or content provided through the Application; or (iv) that
          the Application, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on
          behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses,
          worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any warranty exists
          under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be solely
          responsible for such warranty.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
          of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this
          Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
          limited to the amount actually paid by You for the Application or
          through the Application or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
          through the Application.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or
          third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in
          connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company
          or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages
          and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
          incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
          exclusion may not apply to You.
        </p>
        <h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
        <h3>Severability</h3>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or
          invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish
          the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
          applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full
          force and effect.
        </p>
        <h3>Waiver</h3>
        <p>
          Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
          require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not
          affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
          performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
          constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
        </p>
        <h2>Product Claims</h2>
        <p>
          The Company does not make any warranties concerning the Application.
        </p>
        <h2>United States Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country
          that is subject to the United States government embargo, or that has
          been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
          supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United
          States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to this Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or
          replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will
          provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
          What constitutes a material change will be determined at the sole
          discretion of the Company.
        </p>
        <p>
          By continuing to access or use the Application after any revisions
          become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You
          do not agree to the new terms, You are no longer authorized to use the
          Application.
